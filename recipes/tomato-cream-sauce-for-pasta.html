    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Onion and Garlic:</strong> You'll start this cream sauce for pasta by sauteing garlic and diced onions in olive oil until they're translucent and fragrant.</li>
        <li><strong>Canned Tomatoes:</strong> This convenient cream sauce recipe calls for a can of Italian-style diced tomatoes instead of fresh tomatoes. Don't drain the can, as the juices are necessary for the perfect consistency and flavor. </li>
        <li><strong>Spices and Seasonings:</strong> Dried basil leaves, white sugar, dried oregano, salt, and ground black pepper add a complex savory flavor (with just a touch of sweetness). </li>
        <li><strong>Heavy Cream:</strong> You can't make cream sauce for pasta without cream! For a slightly lighter twist, try using half milk and half heavy cream. </li>
        <li><strong>Butter:</strong> Just a tablespoon of butter ensures a rich, velvety smooth finish. </li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1: </strong>Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes, stirring the garlic in during the last minute. </li>
        <li><strong>Step 2: </strong>Add non drained tomatoes, basil, sugar, oregano, salt, and pepper; stir to combine as it comes to a boil. Continue to boil until most of the liquid evaporates, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 3: </strong>Remove from the heat. Pour in cream and butter; stir to combine. </li>
        <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Return to the stove and simmer over low heat for 5 more minutes. </li>
    </ol>
