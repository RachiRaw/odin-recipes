    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Chef John's version of chicken tinga is full of Mexican flavors and similar to the one with the red sauce that I order at my favorite taqueria. Can be used on tostadas or in burritos, quesadillas, flautas, or tacos. </p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>3 pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs</li>
        <li>4 cups chicken stock</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>1 large yellow onion, halved</li>
        <li>3 peeled whole garlic cloves</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more to taste</li>
        <li>Â½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 large onion, diced</li>
        <li>1 (7 ounce) can chipotle peppers in adobo sauce</li>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) can peeled plum tomatoes (preferably San Marzano)</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro, or more to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons crumbled cotija cheese, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1: </strong>Place chicken thighs, chicken stock, water, halved onion, garlic cloves, salt, and oregano in a large pot. Bring to a simmer over high heat; reduce to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes. Remove from heat. </li>
        <li><strong>Step 2: </strong>Transfer onion halves to a bowl with a slotted spoon; transfer chicken thighs to a separate bowl. </li>
        <li><strong>Step 3: </strong>Pour broth through a strainer into a large bowl.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 4: </strong> Heat olive oil in the same pot over medium heat. Add diced onions and cook until beginning to soften, about 4 minutes. Transfer strained liquid to onions. Bring mixture to a boil over high heat; turn heat to medium-low; reduce broth by about half, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 5: </strong>Transfer reserved boiled onions to a blender. Add chipotle peppers in adobo sauce. Swirl a bit of water in the can and add to the blender. Add tomatoes. Cover blender with the lid; pulse on and off until mixture is partially blended, then blend on medium speed until smooth, 1 or 2 minutes. Transfer to pot with broth and onions.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 6: </strong>Increase heat to medium-high. Simmer 15 minutes or so, depending on how thick you want the sauce. Reduce heat to medium-low.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 7: </strong>Tear chicken into bite-size pieces and add to the pot. Cook another 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer to a serving dish; garnish with cilantro and crumbled cotija cheese.</li>
    </ol>
